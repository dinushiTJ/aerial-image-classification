Key interpretations to draw:

### 1. **Class Clustering in Real Data (Fit)**

* Well-separated clusters per class in the real data indicate your embeddings capture meaningful semantic or visual differences.
* Overlapping clusters in real data may suggest either intrinsic similarity between those classes or weaker embedding discrimination.

### 2. **Synthetic Data Alignment**

* If synthetic embeddings cluster closely around the corresponding real class clusters, it suggests good distribution alignment and realistic synthetic generation for that class.
* Synthetic points scattered far away or overlapping wrong classes indicate poor representation of that class by the synthetic data.

### 3. **Class-wise Diversity in Synthetic Data**

* A tight cluster of synthetic points may indicate low diversity or mode collapse.
* A spread-out but still aligned cluster indicates the synthetic data captures diverse variations of the concept.

### 4. **Class-wise Shifts or Biases**

* Synthetic clusters shifted relative to real clusters (e.g., shifted center or shape) might indicate systematic bias or domain shift.
* Missing clusters or very sparse synthetic points for some classes indicate failure to generate realistic data for those classes.

### 5. **Inter-class Relationships**

* If some classes cluster close in real data, and synthetic embeddings reflect that, itâ€™s a positive sign the synthetic preserves class relationships.
* Synthetic embeddings that create artificial clusters or mix unrelated classes can highlight problems in generation or embedding.

| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Synthetic points tightly aligned with real class clusters | Good distribution alignment, realistic synthetic data | Synthetic data likely useful for augmentation      |
| Synthetic points scattered or mixed across classes        | Poor synthetic data quality or embedding mismatch     | Reconsider synthetic data generation or embeddings |
| Synthetic cluster tighter than real cluster               | Low diversity or mode collapse in synthetic data      | Investigate diversity, adjust synthetic method     |
| Synthetic cluster shifted from real cluster               | Systematic bias or domain shift                       | Investigate and correct synthetic data bias        |
| Missing or sparse synthetic points for classes            | Synthetic generation failure for those classes        | Re-generate or augment data for missing classes    |
